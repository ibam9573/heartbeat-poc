## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later recommended. This application may also work on other operating systems with .NET support.
- **.NET 8:** Ensure that .NET 8 is installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the official Microsoft website.
- **Memory:** Minimum of 4GB RAM is required for proper performance.
- **Disk Space:** At least 100MB of free space for installation.

## üåü Features
- **Minimal API:** Focuses on simplicity and speed in monitoring.
- **Background Service:** Monitors processes without user intervention.
- **Logging:** Keeps track of activities, providing insights into system operations.
- **Fail-Simulation:** Simulate faults to test system resilience.

## üîç How It Works
Heartbeat POC works by sending regular "heartbeat" signals from the monitored processes. This ensures that each task is running smoothly and allows you to detect any failures or delays in real time. 

### Key Functions:
- **Monitoring:** Continuously checks the status of your distributed tasks.
- **Notifications:** Alerts you if a process fails.
- **Logs:** Records all operations for better visibility into system performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you run into issues while running the application, consider the following steps:

- **Check .NET Version:** Confirm that you have .NET 8 installed.
- **Reinstall the Application:** If problems persist, try deleting the existing files and go through the download process again.
- **Consult Logs:** Check the log files created in the application directory for error messages.
